				// This event only fires when the bank is in search mode. It will fire even if there is no search
				// input. We prevent having a tag tab open while also performing a normal search, so if a tag tab
				// is active here it must mean we have placed the bank into search mode. See onScriptPostFired().
				// Shared storage uses the bankmain filter scripts too. Allow using tag searches in it but don't
				// apply the tag search from the active tab.
					// return true
					// if the item isn't tagged we return false to prevent the item matching if the item name happens
					// to contain the tag name.
		// Get both tags and vartags and append * to end of vartags name
					// Split inputted tags to vartags (ending with *) and regular tags
					// And save them
					// If a tab if active, rebuild the bank to apply the changes
