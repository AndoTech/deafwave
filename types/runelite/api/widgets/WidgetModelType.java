Convert this Java code to a typescript .d.ts file. Use external references with naming intention instead of imports, maintain comments, and do not export anything. Only return the code block:


package net.runelite.api.widgets;

public final class WidgetModelType
{
	public static final int NULL = 0;
	public static final int MODEL = 1;
	public static final int NPC_CHATHEAD = 2;
	public static final int LOCAL_PLAYER_CHATHEAD = 3;
	public static final int ITEM = 4;
	public static final int PLAYER = 5;
}
