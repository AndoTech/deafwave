Convert this Java code to a typescript .d.ts file. Use external references with naming intention instead of imports, maintain comments, and do not export anything. Only return the code block:


package net.runelite.api.widgets;

public final class WidgetType
{
	public static final int LAYER = 0;
	public static final int RECTANGLE = 3;
	public static final int TEXT = 4;
	public static final int GRAPHIC = 5;
	public static final int MODEL = 6;
	public static final int TEXT_INVENTORY = 7;
	public static final int IF1_TOOLTIP = 8;
	public static final int LINE = 9;
}
