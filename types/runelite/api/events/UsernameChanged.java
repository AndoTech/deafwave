Convert this Java code to a typescript .d.ts file. Use external references with naming intention instead of imports, maintain comments, and do not export anything. Only return the code block:


package net.runelite.api.events;

/**
 * An event where the username the client will log in with has changed.
 * <p>
 * This event triggers for every character change to the username
 * in the login screen.
 */
public class UsernameChanged
