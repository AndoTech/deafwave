Convert this Java code to a typescript .d.ts file. Use external references with naming intention instead of imports, maintain comments, and do not export anything. Only return the code block:

package net.runelite.api.events;

/**
 * Posted at the end of each client tick (20ms)
 * @see ClientTick
 */
public class PostClientTick
{
}
